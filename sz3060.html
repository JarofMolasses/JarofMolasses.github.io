                        <p>
                            <img src="sz3060/main.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                            The SZ3060 is a low-spec model in the Olympus catalog of stereo microscopes, meant to be integrated into wire bonders and wafer probers. 
                            Nonetheless, it still has excellent optics and good mechanical design. The resolution is good enough, and the contrast is high. This is a 
                            high quality optical system despite the low cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            As shown, the reversing assembly consists of three prisms and two mirrors. In principle, the two additional mirrors cause a minor loss in contrast compared to 
                            full prism designs like the Nikon SMZ-2B. In practice, it's hardly noticeable.
                            
                            <br><br>
                            For a <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/stereomicroscopy/introduction-to-stereomicroscopy">Greenough design</a>, the SZ3060 has good sharpness across the field, due to the low
                            convergence angle of the optical paths (10 degrees) and the close spacing of the lenses. Spherical aberration is not noticeable throughout the zoom range, but there is a 
                            hint of chromatic aberration especially at higher magnification. Adding less-than-perfect auxiliary lenses increases the chromatic aberration further. There is significant pincushion distortion when photographing through the eyepieces; the effect is less pronounced when viewed by a human eye.                           
                            
                            <br><br>
                            The most apparent downside is the 60 degree tilt of the eyetubes, which is generally less ergonomic than the typical 45 degree on most modern microscopes (even 45 degrees is not totally ideal, actually).
                            Traditionally, 60 degree eyetubes were very common - the Bausch and Lomb Stereozoom series (minus the SZ7), the American Optical StereoStar series, the Nikon SMZ-1, and many others all have 60 degree eyetubes. 
                            <img src = "sz3060/angles.png" class = "img-fluid max-width">
                            <i><small>Left: SZ4045 (45 degree), right: SZ3060 (60 degree)</small></i>

                            <br></br>
                            The ergonomics can be improved by sacrificing some usable depth of field and tilting the microscope body downwards 10-15 degrees. At the 
                            low magnifications that we usually use for soldering, the field is often deep enough that the tilt does not cause appreciable degradation of focus. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>Optical alignment</h5>
                        <p>
                            Stereo microscopes require very fine alignment between the two optical paths to present good images that do not cause fatigue for the user. This is complicated by zoom mechanisms, 
                            in that alignment needs to be maintained at all zoom levels.

                            <br><br>
                            By my estimation, there are four main types of misalignments in a zoom stereo microscope:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Misalignment between left and right images</li>
                                <li>Decentration of image when zooming</li>
                                <li>Loss of focus when zooming</li>
                                <li>Decentration of image when adjusting interpupillary distance</li>
                            </ol>

                            The first is by far the most important alignment to get right. Even if the alignment in zooming is poor, the microscope can produce perfectly usable images. However,
                            if there is misalignment between the left and right eyes, the microscope can be essentially inoperable at any zoom level. <br>
                        </p>

                        <h5>Notes on aligning the SZ3060</h5>
                        <p>
                            The <a href = "https://alanwood.net/downloads/olympus-sz3060-sz4045-sz4060-repair-manual.pdf">SZ3060 service manual</a> doesn't mention it, 
                            but a quick fix for misalignment #1 can be done without touching the zoom lenses. I might suggest correcting it this way only if misalignments #2, #3, and #4 are not present or very minor. 
                            If there is major decentration or loss of focus through the zoom range, then the full disassembly and proper alignment should be done. <br><br>
                            <img src="sz3060/eyetubes.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                            The four screws attaching each eyetube assembly to the reversing assembly (called out as <b>AB 3x8SA 8 pcs.</b> in step 2)
                            can be loosened and the eyetubes can be translated as necessary to correct for slight discrepancies between the left and right images. On my copy, the 
                            left/right images did not provide a good stereoscopic view until I corrected this. The other misalignments are present too, but are comparatively minor and do not affect the usage of the scope.
                        </p>

                            Stereo microscopes are not the only way to get a closer look at dense SMT circuits (or other small things), of course.
                            In my opinion, however, a good stereo microscope is the most versatile.
